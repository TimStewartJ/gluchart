# Gluchart
A glucose level prediction model using a LSTM model.

# Overview
Diabetes is a chronic condition that causes problems with the production of insulin, a hormone that our body uses to regulate our sugar levels. With little to no insulin 
being produced in the pancrease, patients with diabetes must regulate their glucose levels by directly injecting insulin.

About two months ago, our friend and fellow Aggie Aidan was diagnosed with Type I diabetes. Since then, he's told us about his struggles in self-administering insulin.
He would inject insulin before a meal, only to find out shortly after that it was an insufficient dosage and have to self-administer again. Worse yet was when he would
overshoot and administer too much insulin, bringing his glucose levels to dangerously low levels that could induce a coma.

We wanted to create an application that could aid Aidan, fellow Aggies, and anyone adjusting to diabetes by showing their glucose levels ahead of time. If successful,
our application could guide people in dosing the correct amount of insulin.

# Goals
Create a glucose prediction model using machine learning that can accurately forecast a person's glucose levels given their current glucose level and an input of insulin/meal.
